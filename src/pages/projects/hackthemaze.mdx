# Hack The Maze

<ProjectLinks title="Devpost" link="https://devpost.com/software/hack-the-maze" icon="eva:globe-outline" />

Hack The Maze is the result of a 36-hour hackathon, the [HackUPC 2022](https://hackupc.com/), where we got a 3rd place.
We participated in the challenge proposed by [IThinkUPC](https://ithinkupc.com/), which was to create a multiplayer game that was fast and useful to disconnect during the hackathon.
We decided to create a simple maze game where the players have to try to reach the exit first.

## Stack

Having little time we decided to use a basic stack that would give us a lot of possibilities.

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

Backend:
- NodeJS
- Express

Communication:
- Socket.io

## My experience

I was in charge of making the frontend, and as I had never made any game or anything that required a constantly updating graphical part, I decided to use the HTML `canvas` itself.
From JS I could paint and update the canvas in real time and with very little load.

As it was a game to disconnect we had to prepare it for mobile devices as well.
In order to make it more comfortable to play, I decided not to use the typical cross controls, and I chose to implement swipe controls.
This way it was much more dynamic, comfortable and intuitive for the user to play.

## Conclusion

This was my first hackathon and when we started I did not expect to be able to create a multiplayer game.
I had to learn, from scratch and in a very short time, how to use and get the most out of technologies such as HTML canvas, which despite being something basic I had never used before.
Solving optimization problems such as repainting only the path instead of the whole maze were challenges that I learned a lot.
