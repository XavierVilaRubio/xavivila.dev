# Why your GitHub profile should stand out?
Last week I hosted a Twitter Space 🎙️ where I got to interact with amazing speakers on GitHub profile. Here's what they said:

**Git** is a version control system which is distributed for free. It’s an open source, fast, and efficient.
**GitHub** is the web platform for hosting our code using Git’s system.

## Why GitHub Profile ??😇
Any person around the world can consult your code and see how you work without having to carry a laptop, a hard drive, or any other device. It is the best way to showcase your projects in a fast and professional way.

## Code📄
Contributing to modern & relevant big known projects where the bar is high shows you are working alongside very talented individuals. May not be same degree of code. But it shows savviness.

Recruiters check, not only the content, but also the activity of your GitHub account. An account which is constantly active shows persistence and commitment.

> Write clean, commented, and well-organized code

The code must not contain duplicate and/or copied lines, therefore create functions that make your code more structured. When leaving comments on the code, the rule is if a person who is external to the project looks at it, they must be able to understand it.

Recruiters value quality work regardless of the goal of the project itself.

## Contribution📌
Contributing to modern & relevant big known projects where the bar is high shows you are working alongside very talented individuals. May not be same degree of code. But it shows savviness.

If you contribute to several large projects with recognizable names & contributors it shows credibility. Proves your ability to collaborate in team environment. Communicating & organizing your thoughts. Managing GitHub issues, conversations & feedbacks.
