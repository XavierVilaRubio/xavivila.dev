# Links

<ProjectLinks github_link="https://github.com/XavierVilaRubio/links" site_link="https://links.xavivila.dev" />

This simple project it's only an alternative to the typical "linktree" page.
As this was a very basic project without much design, I decided to use <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>.
I also used NextJS because it's production-ready and it's very easy to use.
