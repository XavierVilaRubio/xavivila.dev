# Links

<ProjectLinks github_link="https://github.com/XavierVilaRubio/links" site_link="https://links.xavivila.dev" />

Links is a simple, static and responsive page that I created to share my personal links.

## Stack

As it was going to be a fairly quick project I needed a framework that would give me a project ready to publish without too much effort but at the same time let me integrate libraries easily. For this reason I decided to do it with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

As for the design I had nothing in mind, so in order to speed up the process I chose to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
